Be careful when appending, if you run the program twice, it will add 2 times
also it messes up without \n
	
employee_file = open("employees.txt","a")	//Open file in append mode
employe_file.write("Toby- Human Resources ")	//write data
employee_file.close()			//close file



Open your employee.txt file -> Entry will be appended
