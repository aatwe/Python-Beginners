//Now we will use the student class and create student object
app.py
//Object is an actual student using the template //not just template // but a student we are representing inside our program
//Object is an instance of class i.e user of template

1) Import file from class
          //File	   //Class
from Student import Student		

2) Create a class object instance and access infomation
//Object     Class	
student1 = Student("Jim", "Business", 3.1, False)		//Create object 1 like a normal variable
student2 = Student("Pam", "At", 2.5, True)		//Create object 2

print(student1.name)		//Use object with class method

Output: Jim
