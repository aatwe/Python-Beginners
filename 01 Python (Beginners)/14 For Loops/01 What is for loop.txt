range(10) = all no. in between 0 and 10 (not equalto10)

for index in range(len(10)):		
			//prints all no. in between 0 and 10 (not equalto10)
	print(index)

for index in  range(3,10)		

	print(index)	//prints all no. in between 3 and 10(not equalto10)


for index in range(5)"
      if index == 0:
	print("first Iteration")
       else:
