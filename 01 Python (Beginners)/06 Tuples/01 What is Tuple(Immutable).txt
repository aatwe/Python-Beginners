tuple_name = (4,5)
//cannot be changed


A type of data structure that cannot be changed
Similar to list but
	() instead of []
	Not mutable/modifiable
	
1) How to create a tuple?
	tuple_name = (4,5)
Ex 	coordinates = (3,4)

2) How to print tuple?	print(tuple_name(index))
print(coordinates[0])
Output: 4
print(coordinates[1])
Output: 5

3) How to change entries? 	Cannot It is immutable
coordinates[1] = 10
//Output: Error


4) Use case: List of coordinate tuples
coordinates = [(4,5), (6,7) , (80,34)]
